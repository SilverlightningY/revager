The package org.revager.test and its sub-packages contain the classes for unit
testing (JUnit 4). The complete code is statement-covered except:

 * the package org.revager.gui and its sub-packages because the classes in these
   packages contains the graphical user interface of the software, which is
   tested in the system test;
  
 * the package org.revager.app.model.schema because the classes in this package
   are automatically generated by JAXB (external component);
  
 * the external components iText and Derby (Java DB) because they are not part
   of the development process of this software project and tested separately;
  
 * some trivial code which can only be reached if internal errors occur; these
   code positions are marked with a short comment which says the reason for the
   exclusion from unit testing.



              ATTENTION! READ BEFORE STARTING WITH UNIT TESTING!              

 * You have to run each JUnit test class separately. It is not possible to run
   the package org.revager.test as a test suite.
